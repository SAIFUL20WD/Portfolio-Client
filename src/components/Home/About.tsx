				Hi there! I'm a passionate Full-Stack web developer. I have a
				strong background in frontend development using React and
				typescript, as well as experience with various JavaScript and
				CSS libraries and frameworks such as Next.JS and Tailwind. In
				addition to my frontend expertise, I have a decent understanding
				of backend technologies like Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.
				This knowledge enables me to collaborate effectively with
				backend teams, bridging the gap between the front and back ends
				of web development projects. I'm excited to continue my journey
				in the tech world, eager to learn and contribute to innovative
				projects. Let's connect and explore opportunities together!
